  <title>Safety: Instructions for Palestine, by Angie Hassanein</title>

    	<!-- Safety reimplementation, 
copyright (c) 2019, 2024 Angie Hassanein 
based on a 2019 program by Nick Montfort  
https://nickm.com/poems/safety.html


This uses a generative text algorithm to create a series of war related safety instructions. The instructions, while random, are meant to envoke the realities of life in a conflict zone. The script generates a new set of instructions every five seconds, mirrioring the unpredictable and rapidly changing circumstances Palestinians must face. This is a statement on human condition and a call to empathy and understanding.

    I wrote this text generator in Python on April 7, 2008, never distributed or
    exhibited it, and just found it recently among older files. On September 15,
    2019, I wrote this HTML/JavaScript implementation of the generator. In terms
    of the way text is generated, this version functions exactly as does the
    2008 Python program. The typography is different, as the Python program runs
    in a terminal window.

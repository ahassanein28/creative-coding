        <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
        <p>
            My pixel art project is based on a photo I took last weekend while at a concert. The inspiration comes from a song by the artist called 'Long Live' that explores the relationship between fan and artist while at a concert. The lyrics in connection with the photo itself represent the momentary bond built between artist and fan as well as fan to fan. </p>

Modern Perverbs reimplementation, 
copyright (c) 2014, 2024 Angie Hassanein 
based on a 2014 program by Nick Montfort
https://nickm.com/poems/perverbs.html

'Voices from Palestine' is meant to amplify the voices of Palestinian poets in a unique way. 

The heart of this art lies in its use of random generators that when viewed on its own, may seem nonsensical. However, when these are pieced together, they form a mosaic of experiences and emotions that reflect the life of a Palestinian. 

The data in the project mainly came from two poems written by Palestinian artists, 
1. 'If I must Die' by Refaat Alareer (https://inthesetimes.com/article/refaat-alareer-israeli-occupation-palestine)
2. 'Enough for Me' by Fadwa Tuqan /Translated by Michael R Burch/ (https://allpoetry.com/poem/14756670-Fadwa-Tuqan-translations-by-Michael-R.-Burch)
